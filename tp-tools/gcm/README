# ORT/GCM: ORCA-RT-TOOLS/Graph Collapse Method

This module implements the collapse algorithm for graph clustering

`gcm <ifile> <num_nodes> <criteria>`

- `ifile`: Input file containing a graph description (ORCA format)
- `num_nodes`: Target number of clusters (WARN: graph must have a single component; i.e: disjoint sets of connected vertices are not allowed) 
- `criteria`: criteria to tag edges for removal
